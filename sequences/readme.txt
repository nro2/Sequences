This assignment includes several files:

- readme.txt 		 this file

- instructions.txt	 detailed assignment instructions

- background.txt 	 a (very) short story giving background and context
  			 for the assignment. This file is optional and you

  			 from a file and put them in a list.

- medium.txt
